## Step 1: Profiling 📈

🐉 I have been thinking of creating a searchable library of all Dungeons & Dragons sources for a while now, partly because it sounds fun, partly so I can connect use all of them while DMing, and lastly, partly because I think there might some interesting patterns to identify in them.

📊By profiling the data I can start seeing if the last in true and what those patterns are.

👾In the original 5e monster manual we find 327 monsters. Most of them are beasts of differnt sizes and alignments. The most common armour class is 12 and most of them can only walk 30ft per turn, with about 10 per type of movement having some kind of fly/swim/climb speed. They heavily favour strength and constitution as stats with a mean of >15 and max 30 for both. The most common stat that gets extra stats is perception, the most common immunity is poison and the most usual vulnerability is fire.

🤖Next step: more advanced analytics to see more trends.

📝I have been struggling with needing to complete projects before I can talk about them, but that puts too much pressure on it being perfect to ever even start. So I decided to post about things gradually to get more joy out of the small steps.
