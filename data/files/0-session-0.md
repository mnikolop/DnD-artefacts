## Out of game expectations

### [Alcohol](a "Can players drink at the table? Do you care if your players get drunk? What happens when someone gets drunk? What happens when a player arrives to the session and they are already drunk? Should there be consequences, and if so, what are the consequences?")

Players are allowed to drink alcohol at the table, as long as it does not impede them or they become too intoxicated to perform.

### [Narcotics](a "Same considerations as Alcohol, but perhaps you have different rules and consequences than with Alcohol. Though perhaps similar, I have found it best to discuss this seperately from Alcohol.")

Narcotics are allowed as long as they do not impede the player’s ability to perform or engage.

### [Cellphones and digital devices](a "Do you allow them at the table? Do they need to be left in the basket at the door? If you do allow them, what happens when a player gets a call they must take? Do you allow headphone use at the table? Should there be consequences for when this becomes a problem, if so, what are the consequences?")

Cell phones are discouraged but allowed in session.

### [Player attention](a "What happens if a player is constantly distracted? What happens if they are constantly delaying the game because they are NOT paying attention? Should there be consequences for when this becomes a problem, if so, what are the consequences?")

Destructed players will be verbally reprimanded for the first few occurrences. If the situation continues there will be in-game consequences for the player’s character (from here on out referred to as PC), proportional to the amount of lack of attention.

### [Disruptive topics](a "Are real-life topics like religion, politics, porn or sex okay at your table? What about sports? Are there other topics that are disruptive? Maybe it's ok to talk about these kind of things before the session starts, but not during the session? Many of these topics can lead to heated discussions that can be disruptive to a game session and upsetting to other players. While this more applies to online D&D games, it can still be an issue for offline D&D games as well. Should players arrive an hour early so that they can do a bit of socializing before the session?")

#### Soft limits

#### Hard limits

- Homophobia
- Transphobia
- Racism
- Missogyny
- Rape/Sexual asault
- Necrophilia
- White slavery
- Pedophelia
- Slavery
- Eye torture
- Coprophilia

### [Unannounced dice rolls](a "What happens when a player make a dice-rolls without saying anything, only then to say, 'I just rolled a nat-20 on my perception check'? Are dice rolls only allowed to me made when prompted? How are dice rolls handled? Can players can make their rolls when they think they need to?")

Unannounced rolls will be disregarded. A dice roll is valid and will be used only if it has been requested or announced and accepted.

### [Dice rolls against one another](a "Are dice rolls allowed to be used to settle in-character arguments? Can one PC roll to persuade another PC that his course of action is right? Or is this kind of thing not allowed at all? Is it something that's allowed sparingly, but only under DM guidance, or only when prompted by the DM? Perhaps everyone at the table has to agree to allow such rolls first?")

In-character arguments will be decided with rolls if needed. The roll is determined by the DM in discussion with the player.

### [Player vs player](a "Is tension between characters allowed? What about argument between characters? Is combat between two or more PCs allowed? What happens when character tension finally breaks out into violence between those two characters? Is allowed only if the DM approves? Does the whole table have to approve the PvP? What is your stance on PvP as a DM?")

In-character arguments are allowed as long as they are not out of hand and are not violating any of the limits set in this document. Battle between PCs is allowed but the DM will intervene if a PC death is going to happen, unless otherwise decided.

### [PC secrets](a "Are players allowed to keep in-game secrets from other players? Are characters allowed to keep in-game secrets from other characters? If so, who decides what secrets are allowed? Is this sort of thing left up to the players? Is it only the privilege of the DM?")

The amount of information about their backstory they are willing to disclose lyes with each player about their PD. This means that each player can have secrets from other players or PCs. The DM is the only other person that knows all secrets, so they can plan with and for them.

### [Player expectations, types, goals and diversity](a "What happens when one player's expectations ruins the fun of another player? Does every player at your table need to be there for the same reasons as every other player? Is it okay for one to be there only for the sweet loots and experience, while another is there to role-play his deep personality, while yet another is there to just 'kill shit'? DMs you may want to discuss with each player at the table, why they are here and what they hope to get out of the game, and how you as a DM can meet those hopes and expections. If for some reason you cannot, discuss that with the player and offer what you can do instead. After you have, you may want to reinforce that you are all there to have fun, but have different ideas of what fun is.")

Player expectations may very but to the extent that they do not become obstructive to the game for the rest of the party and the DM. If a player is becoming problematic and cites that they are following their own expectations, a discussion will be had to determine if said expectations can be met by realigning them or the group’s, or the player will be asked to leave the table.

### [Player discomfort](a "Occasionally things may happen in-game that makes a player uncomfortable. There may be times where everyone agreed about a particular topic in session-0, but when it actually surfaces in-game, the player may find out that they in fact are NOT comfortable with it. How are such things handled? Is there a time-out system? Does the DM call a break and this become a table discussion? Is the player allowed to step out on the scene and come back after it has passed? Does the DM use a retcon to the story?")

Player comfort will always take precedence in this game. Even if a topic has been discussed in session-0 as ok, but in game any of the players become uncomfortable they are allowed to inform the DM.
A four traffic light system is going to be implemented in this game to ensure player and DM comfort.

- Green: it means everything is fine, we can keep going. It does not need to be specified. Unless indicated otherwise all players are assumed to be on a green status. The green card can be used for example in heated situations where the PC is in distress but the player is not and would like the situation to keep going.
- Yellow/orange: things are becoming uncomfortable, please take a step back. The player can but is not required to indicate which aspect of the situation is upsetting them so the DM can move forward accordingly.
- Red: the game stops immediately.
- Blue: indicates a need for a break. If it is flushed and the player removes themselves from the table it means they need a water or toilet break. If it is up for an extended period of time then the player is indicating fatigue and burn-uot and the need for a break. If it is combined with the red card it means the player needs a break, needs the situation to stop and requires the DM to talk to them about it.

These can be actual physical cards that the player can hold up for the DM to see.
If the DM feels they are venturing on uncharted territory or towards situations that might become problematic they are going to ask for a colour status from the players, both to assess the situation and to remind them of their ability to use the colours.
Any topics that have been indicated with a red card will be added to the list of hard limits in this document. If a topic causes a yellow card to be raised it will be discussed on whether it should be added to the soft or hard limits in this document but it will be added in one of them.

### [Player agency](a "How do you feel about player agency? What is your stance on it? Is it a possibility that a PC becomes a DM-controlled character? What are the ways PCs can use to un-petrify their fellow PCs from the effects of a Basilisk? Historically, D&D has not cared much about player agency. What the DM says is what goes, but it has gotten significantly better about it as the editions have passed. Save-or-die effects kind-of linger but are gone for the most part. Players (veteran or not) coming to play D&D though, may actually welcome and want this kind of thing, while other players may not. DMs you may want to discuss it with your table.")

Spotlight is to be shared between all players. If a player is hogging the spotlight they will be reprimanded and if the behaviour continues they will be disciplined in game. If the behaviour still continues the player will be removed from the table.

### [Spotlight sharing](a "Are players allowed to have spotlight focus? Or will the spotlight only be focused on the party as a whole? Are players or characters allowed to steal another PCs spotlight? What happens if a player or his/her character tramples over another characters scene/spotlight? This kind of thing can ruin another player's fun, but it is also the kind of action that the player won't immediately voice their discomfort about. DMs you may want to try to be watchful of this.")

Meta-gaming is not allowed in this game. If a player keeps meta-gaming and does not correct their behaviour when told so, they will be punished in game.

### [Meta-gaming](a "Do you allow it? Is it okay for players to know that swinging their weapon as a ghost will not harm it? Are characters allowed to know that trolls don't regenerate health when harmed with acid or fire? What about when it comes to multiple rolls? Just because the Wizard player knows the Rogue rolled low for his check for traps, would it make sense for the Wizard character to insist that he check as well? If some meta knowledge is okay, and others are not, please discuss that with your players. Where is the limit? Though it gets talked about like it's some sort of sin, some metagame knowledge is okay to have at your table as long as everyone is having fun.")

All types of PCs are allowed. As long as the player can support the play, they are allowed to have any type of optimization they like.
Game style is to be decided with the whole group.

### [Min-maxing](a "What is your stance on this as a DM? Do you welcome optimized characters, even if the character concept/theme is ridiculous? Perhaps you simply tolerate it, as long as it doesn't become an issue? Or perhaps you and your players decided to play a campaign that is more about ROLL-play than ROLE-play? Are veterans allowed to help newer players optimize their PCs? If optimized PCs are allowed or encouraged, you may want to let your players know that it is also fine to play unoptimized characters as well.")

A meet and greet will be set up between all players. If not possible before session 0, at that session all players should be introduced to each other and get acquainted. If a player keeps bringing problematic PCs to the game even after they have been warned, they will be removed from the game.
The same applies to all players getting introduced to the game at a later time.

### [Character party fit](a "That 'loner' character? Are they allowed? If so, at what limits? Is it okay if a PC just tags along ONLY to do combat and avoid anything social? D&D is a social-based game, you may wish to encourage your players to create characters that play well with others and that will fit with the party. On the other hand, you may want to be mindful about players potentially bullying other players into playing races and classes they do not want to play. Party fit should not limit class and race choice.")

If there is a valid justification for the player to be a murder-hobo, if their background and PC supports it, then it is allowed.

### [Murder hobos](a "What is your stance on this as a DM? Is it allowed? Is it allowed, but there will be in-game consequences? Maybe your playing an evil campaign and this is exactly what you want in this campaign. DMs understand that D&D by its nature and history encourages this style of game-play, so be forgiving but mindful.")

- Respect other people's limits
- Do not be a rules lawyer
- The DM has final say
- Communicate any concerns to other players or the DM

### [Other behavior rules](a "Perhaps this is where you tell your players to be respectful to one another, or be communicative, etc.")

## [Ethic concerns](a "This part will cover mature topics and is here to avoid just suddenly triggering players, by bringing these topics on the table up front. They can be discussed and should be discussed in a mature respectful manor. It's important to include a preface to this topic-set. Be as respectful and as frank as possible but ask for forgiveness incase you happen to fall short. These are not easy topics to discuss but should be brought up at the table during session zero regardless. For these topics, it is important to address every player at the table for their individual input & then individual consent.")

### [Attraction and sexual orientation](a "Discuss the possibilities of attraction or sexual orientation of both the PCs and the NPCs, as well as the populous in general, in your setting/campaign. Are there cultural stigmas on select sexual orientations that span across multiple races? Does each race/culture have different views that vary? Does each individual make this decision for themselves? Does religion or government have an effect here? Are some cultures, religions or governments more accepting than others? Is it alright a character to experience attraction from others that may not match their personal views as a player. You may want to ask if they will be uncomformable as a player with seeing interactions in character that may not align to their personal views.")

Sexual orientation and attraction are a spectrum and this is also reflected in the setting of this game. The way both of these are accepted though the game’s world is the same as earth in 2021. Some cultures, races and religions are more accepting of this than others.
PCs are allowed to experience all sexual orientations and attractions. It is recomended to not “perform” an orientation that is outside of the player’s orientation and sexuality as a person so as to not seem as performative, homophobic, transphobic or similar.

### [Rape and sexual assault](a "What is your stance on this topic? Are characters allowed to have had this happen in their background/past? Maybe you do just limit it to the past, but never the present. Can it happen to NPCs but not PCs? Are characters allowed to perform these acts? If so, is it done only 'off-camera'?")

### [Slavery](a "DMs consider discussing with your table, the stance you have on this topic. Can PC expect to encounter enslaved NPCs? Can PC become enslaved, or does it only happen to NPCs? Can this be a part of the PCs background? If a PC does become enslaved, does the PC somehow become an NPC? How is slavery viewed in your setting by the various cultures in your game? Do only certain races seek to enslave others, or does every race have the potential to take slaves? Perhaps a certain race is a slave race, similar to house-elves in Harry Potter? After you have discussed this topics, it maybe best to conclude with a reassuring follow-up. Remind there players that these are being discussed now to avoid player discomfort later on, so that everyone can have a fun game. Remind players that at any time, even if it goes against what you agreed upon, or what was discussed during a Session-0 that they feel uncomfortable, to please say something.")

## Practicalities

### [Arranging the sessions](a "Are session played on a regular schedule, for instance monday night every week? Every two weeks? First monday each month? Or are sessions planned and a session by session basis? If so, when is the next session planned? Right before/after the session, or inbetween sessions?")

Future sessions will be arranged at the end of each session. Cancellation needs to occur 48-24 hours before the arranged time of the session, and is highly recommended (almost mandated) for a rescheduling date to be provided. If cancellation needs to occur less than 24 hours from the session, a good reason needs to be provided. If the practice occurs too often the option will be not available anymore with the player having to miss sessions. If a player misses 3 sessions without notice or with a weak excuse they will be removed from the table.

### [Player absence](a "You may want to discuss with your players, how many players get to be absent for the session before the game is cancelled that night? What is the minimum amount of people you will DM for in a session? What happens when too few players show up? Maybe the players that do show up get in some 'down-time' play that can provide minor benefits or perhaps progresses some down-time activities that had going on? Maybe you can do a one-shot you been planning for? What is your backup plan; play board-games, video-games? watch movies?")

Absence is handled in levels of ¼ presence of the group.

- 4/4 presence: Session takes place as planned.
- ¾ presence: PCs will be handled as missing. Each player has the option to decide how their PC will be handled in their absence. This can be changed case by case but they can have a preference.
- 2/4 presence: Players that are present will get a side-quest. It will be discussed if the developments of this side-quest will be present in the main campaign.
- ¼ presence: Session is canceled. The players that are present can choose to have a discussion about the state of the group and/or campaign but otherwise the session is canceled.
  The players can choose from the following how their PC will be handled on arranged leave of absence:
- DM controlled
- Other player controlled
- Abduction / planar shift etc. This can be chosen in cases of longer absence and can lead to a quest for the rest of the party.
- In rare cases where a player knows that they will be missing sessions often a mechanic can be established for them to disappear, such as them falling ill, or “blinking” over short periods of time.
- Join online: If able a player should choose to join the game online.

### [Rules debates](a "How do you handle rules debates? Does the game pause to look up rules? Does the DM make a quick ruling to keep game flow and then the rule is looked up after the session? Perhaps as a DM you use some combination of both?")

Rules can be debated during the session. If a ruling cannot be found the DM decides on something, makes a note and after the session looks for more info and after discussion with the party decides to create a homebrew rule if needed.

### [Food, snacks and drinks](a "If your sessions overlap a meal, how do you handle this? Do people bring their own food? Do you order or make food together? Do you eat while playing, or do you take a break while eating?")

During online sessions, the players are allowed to eat while playing, but requested not to cook. During in person sessions players are allowed to eat as long as the act does not become disruptive for them or the rest of the table.

## Playstyle

### [Type of Game](a "Is this a sandbox game, or more of a rail-road? Perhaps its a rail-road that leads to a sandbox game? Perhaps a sandbox game where players can jump on and off the railroad only at certain points, or perhaps whenever they like? Will the campaign be following a campaign book, and if so, how closely? Does the setting revolve around the players, or are the players just a tiny cog in a much much larger world? What kind of narrative with the game be? Is it something like LotR or will it involve more mystery and conspiracy, or will it feature heavy political themes, like Game of Thrones? Will the players be driven into a main plot by the DM, or are they responsible for creating the plot themselves? Something in-between?")

### [Pet peeves](a "This is where you can discuss your own personal pet-peeves. Things about the game that really bother you as a DM. Just remember that when discussing them, your coming from a place of kindness and doing so to inform them so to avoid issues later on.")

- Tardiness
- Not paying attention
- Complete refusal to role-play
- Responding “I don’t know” when asked what they would like to do
- ...

### [Game balance and fairness](a "As a DM, what are your feelings about the balance of the game you are playing? How will you as a DM handle encounter balance? Will you constantly be throwing only deadly encounters at the PCs? Perhaps you feel that in this kind of sandbox campaign, players can stumble into the Ancient Red Dragons lair at level 1? OR perhaps you feel that the game is broken, or the balance it presents is a farce, so you will employ other means of being fair to your players? Will you as a DM present challenges that will be hopeless when faced head-on, requiring the party to be highly tactical and gather information beforehand? Or will the encounters be laid out to always be 'fair' towards the party?")

### [Notes](a "Are the players required to remember everything that happens? If so, is there a system in place for taking notes? Is every player responsible for taking notes, or is there a designated note-taker? What happens when the players forget crucial details?")

## Experience

### [Earning XP](a "How do players earn XP? Do monsters/creatures have to be slain, or is it good enough to find some other past the challenge? What if the players defeat a monster non-violently? Do you even earn XP at all, or use the _milestones_ variant (DMG p. 261)?")

### [Level-up](a "When do PCs level up? Long rest? Short rest? Once they are back in town? The moment they gain enough exp? Or will level-ups be handled by the players in-between sessions?")

Level-ups will be handled first thing on the session right after the player has achieved the needed XP for the level-up/completed teh milestone. The players are requested to research any spells, feets, attributes they would like to level up in-between sessions. The level up will preferably take place during a long or short rest but it is not mandatory.

## Character creation

### [Creation questions](a "DMs if you have some questions you want your players to answer about their characters durring creation, this is the place to list them. You may want to consider things like; Why is your character an adventurer? How is your character connected to at least one other character in the group? Who are your characters parents, siblings, mentors, etc? Are questions can be answered collaboratively by the group and the DM to create a cohesive party, or are the characters more freely defined by the player himself?")

Each PC needs to have at least an idea written down for the following questions.

- Why is your PC an adventurer?
- How is your PC connected to at least one other PC in the group?
- Who are your PCs' parents, siblings, mentors, etc?
- Where does the PC come from? Please describe the society in that place.
  - Is it religious?
  - What god do they follow?
  - Is it a matriarchal or patriarchal society?
  - What is the size of the population?
  - Are they focused on a specific trade?
- Does the PC need to get somewhere?

### [Ability scores](a "What method is used for creating ability scores, and why? Standard array, point buy, or rolling for stats? If PCs are allowed to roll, do you follow a house-rule set or use the one from the PHB? If ability scores are created randomly, what happens if one character is vastly superior or inferior to the rest of the party? Discuss if this kind of situation can cause tension and take away the fun for one or more players.")

The preferred method for ability scores is standard array. However each player is free to use other methods as available in the PC creation system in dndbeyond.

### [Hit points](a "Are PCs allowed to roll hit-dice for HP or do they take the average? Or can they themselves choose what method to use?")

Players are to roll hit dice for HP when leveling up. If they choose to use the average they have to notify.

### [Alignment](a "How heavily is alignment featured in your game? Is alignment perceptive or descriptive? What kind of things can cause a character to change alignment? What happens when a character changes alignment? Is there the potential for class features to because unusable or even lost due to alignment change? Perhaps you do not allow PCs to have alignment, but NPCs and monster do, just for those few game mechnics that rely on it? Can a player's actions be prohibited by his characters alignment?")

Alignment is used in a few different things in the campaign.

- Role Playing
- Interactions with NPCs
- Interactions/attunement to specific items
- …

A PC’s alignment can change for on or more of the following reasons:

- Certain items
- Behaviour outside of their alignment. This will happen if they behave 3 times outside their alignment.

### [Stat rulings](a "DMs if you have additional rules concerning stats, you may discuss them here. Keep these rules only to stats that may affect character creation, there will be another section for listing other mechanics that may affect game-play and/or characters. Maybe you have an optional Age-trade rule where the elderly gets a +2Wis but suffers a -1Dex & -1Con. Perhaps you have a house rule where characters with 8 or less Int, can not read or write. Discuss these house-rules which have an effect on attribute score discisions.")

### [Other Creation Rules](a "If you have other rules or limitations or expansions on character creation for your campaign, then list them here. Are you perhaps using the Renown optional rules from the DMG here? Perhaps you allow every player to get a feat at first level? If you restrict certain races or classes or sub-classes, that is the for the next topic.")

## Races and classes

### [Races allowed/disallowed](a "Are there any races you disallow? Do you allow flying races? Do you allow homebrew races? Do you allow Unearthed Arcana Races? Elemental Evil Races? Sword Coast Adventure Guide? Volo's Guide? What about the Magic The Gathering Unearthed Arcana Races? Maybe you will some races with a minor tweak to them?")

All races are allowed.

### [Tweaking/reflavor races](a "Can PCs make minor tweaks to a race? Can PCs reflavor a race to be a different race? Do you allow PCs to play races they homebrewed themselves?")

If a player is not satisfied with any of the races available in dndbeyond, or are available for purchase in the system, they are allowed to suggest edits to a race. It is expected to work with the DM to make said edits or make them themselves. The new race needs to “work” with the setting and the rest of the party.

### [Classes allowed](a "Are there any classes you disallow? Do you allow homebrew classes or only homebrew classes from recognised sources, such as Matt Mercer and Sterling Vermin? Do you allow Unearthed Arcana classes/sub-classes, e.g. the Unearthed Arcana Mystic? Sword Coast Adventure Guide sub-classes?")

All classes are allowed.

### [Tweaking/reflavor classes](a "Can PCs make minor tweaks to a class or subclass, if it fits a certain theme that you as the DM can agree with? Can PCs reflavor a class to be a different theme, such as a Bard reflavored as Pro Wrestler?")

If a player is not satisfied with any of the classes available in dndbeyond, or are available for purchase in the system, they are allowed to suggest edits to a class. It is expected to work with the DM to make said edits or make them themselves. The new class needs to “work” with the setting and the rest of the party.

## Game-style, character lifestyle

### [Campaign Length (Contributed by /u/AeoSC)](a "Discuss how long you think this campaign will run for, will characters be able to reach level 9? level 14? How many sessions you expect the campaign go?")

This campaign will be an ongoing campaign and will end either when the players and DM decide to end it or when the players reach level 20.

### [In-game adventurers](a "What can PCs expect from being an adventurer? Are adventurers all heroes, or are they perhaps members of an adventuring guild? Or are they all pirates on a pirate ship? Perhaps they are all members of a faction? Do Adventurers have 'normal lives' during downtime? How do NPCs generally view adventurers? Is it favorable? or are they looked down upon because they cause more trouble than good? Or perhaps because only the desperate take up the adventuring life? Is this perception different based on culture?")

In this setting the players are adventurers roaming the land alone. They can join any guild they come across to improve their access to resources and/or quests but it is not mandatory.

### [In-game politics and factions](a "What are the various factions at play? Can PCs join or already start as members of a faction? What kind of government do the PCs live under? Is it a feudal system? A magocracy? A republic? A tribe? Will the PCs be able to choose to change factions or move to live under a different form of government? What impact does the 'standard adventurer' have on the political landscape? Can the PCs go beyond what the 'standard adventurer' can do? Can the PCs effect change on the political landscape? Can PCs become part of the government? Can PCs even overthrow the government?")

The party will encounter all types of political situations depending on the location. This game follows the Forgotten realms and Wildmound geopolitical settings and unless stated otherwise the politics are as stated in those modules.

### [Start/standing](a "Are characters starting at 1st level, or perhaps at a higher level? If they are starting off as a higher level, are these characters members of a town? A guild? A religion? How long have they been members? How did the character get their higher levels? During this time, have these character somehow earned some minor notoriety?")

For this campaign players will be starting at level 1.
</Standing needs to be defined.>

### [Character Context](a "DMs you may want to consider covering the kinds of things that character may know vs what the player may know and the distinction in-between. The character has potentially lived 15+ years in this setting and may know things that a player would not. DMs, if meta-gaming is a concern for you, this is another place where you can break it down, and how you handle it. How can a player have access to something the character may know, should know, will know? Do they ask to roll for this? Do they automatically become told this knowledge by the DM when circumstances trigger it? Can players freely ask? Perhaps you use a mix of all of the above.")

Since meta-gaming is not allowed, PC context is very important. The PC does not always know the same things as the player. If there is ambiguity the player can ask if they would know this, or the DM will prompt a similar question to the player as well. If knowledge is missing or forgotten the player will be asked to perform a check to either get it or remember it. Checks like these might be prompted by the player, the DM or the story.

## Backgrounds and feats

### [Backgrounds](a "How do backgrounds effect the characters lifestyle? Do you as a DM limited any backgrounds? Do you use backgrounds as all? If you do, do you want final approval of each background selection? Do you allow players to tweak or homebrew their own backgrounds? Have you homebrewed any background for you to use in you campaign?")

None of the existing backgrounds are limited. If a player decides to create a homebrew background, they will be requested to provide the information needed for it or homebrew it themselves. Homebrewed backgrounds are going to be checked to ensure that they do not contain any topics from the hard or soft limits lists.

### [Feats](a "Do you allow feats in the game? Do feats, like the Actor feat, effect backgrounds and the characters lifestyle? Do you as a DM limit any feats? Do you want final approval of each feat selection? Do you allow for the Unearthed Arcana Feats? Have you homebrewed any Feats for use in your campaign? Have you tweaked some of the stock feats? Do you restrict or allow any feat in particular?")

None of the existing feats are limited. If a player decides to create a homebrew feat, they will be requested to provide the information needed for it or homebrew it themselves. Homebrewed feats are going to be checked to ensure that they do not contain any topics from the hard or soft limits lists. Feats have to be discussed with the DM before being chosen so they are able to braid them in the story.

## Genereal mechanic rules

### [Ready an Action](a "DMs, this is confusing. It might be a good idea to cover & discuss this mechanic with your table. Consider perhaps going as far as to break it down step-by-step the requirements for using this feature, the cost, & risk involved.")

Reading an action works as described in the rules.

### [Bonus Actions](a "You may want to clarify what a bonus action is, & when it can be taken and that wording is important. How do bonus actions work in relation to the Ready an Action. If you use any house-rules for being able to use a Bonus action as an Action, then list & define that here, or any other rules you have for bonus actions.")

Bonus actions work as described in the rules.

### [Repeated Party Rolls](a "DMs considering discussing how you handle these. Does the entire party get to roll perception-checks to spot the hidden door & you take the highest? Perhaps you rule as a DM that only the person that ask, gets to roll & any additional PCs can provide the Help action & that is it? Perhaps you have a different system?")

Party rolls are rolled in the cases the whole party is trying to perform a task together. Otherwise only the PCs that requested the roll make it. In case a second set of PCs requests the same roll after the first ones have done theirs and have gotten an answer the DC is higher.

### [Downtime/Crafting](a "Is there down-time for your PCs? Do you use the downtime RAW? About how much time passes between sessions/adventures? Do you have an alternate down-time system? What do characters do during down-time, what CAN they do during down time? What can PCs craft? Do you use crafting RAW? or did you tweak it?")

There is downtime that the PCs can utilise as they see fit. Downtime is not strictly between sessions. If at the end of a session the DM sees that we are at a point where downtime would be beneficial, or if the PCs ask for some, a discussion is held to determine what they are thinking of doing during that time. If it is decided that the tasks are not important or not interesting enough they are performed between sessions with discussion. If they are interesting, could have potential for failure or are important they are performed during the next session.

### [Additional mechanic rules](a "If you have additional rules that focus on general game play that isn't covered by another topic in this article, list them here. You may want to consider additionally discussing; what is involved in Taming creatures; how much damage you get from Lava/Magma; the breakdown of how Dark-vision, Darkness, & Dim light work, in addition to your other house-rules.")

- Lightning damage is homebred to have additional mechanics in water.
- Most trauma is healed after a long rest. For damage that could be permanent (missing parts etc) repeated greater restoration could potentially restore the damage, otherwise it is permanent and should/could be added to the PC’s description.
- Speaking during battle is a free action, to the extent that it’s not a full conversation.

## Inspiration

### [Gaining Inspiration](a "How do players gain inspiration? Does the DM award it? Do players award each other? If players award each other, does the DM have 'veto' power? Can players have multiple sources of inspiration? Can players have more than one inspiration at a time? Perhaps you scrap the inspiration system because everyone seems to forget about it? Can the players ask for inspiration?")

Inspiration is awarded to a player by the DM. Reasons for gaining inspiration include but are not limited to:

- Puns inspired jokes
- Role Playing
- Ingenuous solutions to problems

### [Tracking Inspiration](a "Does the player with inspiration get a special dice? a special token? Can you keep inspiration from the end of one gaming session to the next gaming session? Can players SHARE inspiration freely with one another? Do you have a system to REMEMBER inspiration?")

Inspiration is tracked by the players. If dndbeyond is allowing for multiple inspiration points to be tracked in the PC sheet then they are to be tracked there, otherwise they are to be tacked manually on paper. For ease the points should correspond to each letter of the word INSPIRATION. I.e the first point corresponds to I, the second to N and so on, if the point is spent the letter is erased.

### [Spending Inspiration](a "How does a player spend inspiration? Does inspiration aand bardic inspiration provide some sort of super inspiration? If a player somehow has a pool of inspiration tokens, can a player use spend more than one of those on a single roll? Can a player use Inspiration after seeing the result of the dice, or does it have to be declared before? Do the players have to come up with an in-game reason that ties the inspiration to the improved result?")

- 1 point can be used to allow advantage on a roll
- In case of disadvantage 1 point can be used to turn the roll to a normal one. 2 points can be used to turn the roll to one with advantage.
- 2 points can be used to recover a spell slot (the point system might be adjusted for higher level slots)

## Ability checks

### [Giving Aid](a "Does providing aid, provide straight advantage; or perhaps does the PC giving aid need proficiency in the skill they are using in making the check? Are those perception checks or the Search actions, exempt from this ruling? Is there a time limit on the kind of task that PC an provide aid for? Are these questions perhaps answered on a case-by-case basis?")

When giving aid to a check the 2 players can either do a single check each, or one can grant advantage to the other.

### [Multiple Attempts](a "Can a rogue make that lock picking attempt over and over and over again? As a DM, at what point do you draw the line on multiple attempts? Perhaps as a DM, you would raise the DC in such a case? If so, state what it is. What if the Bard gives the Rogue his bardic inspiration, does this perhaps reset the DC to what it was? What if the rogue took a short rest before trying again? What if the rogue instead spends his inspiration?")

Multiple attempts are allowed. Depending on the check the following check might fall under one of the following 3 categories:

- Different check: If a player fails on a check but decides they need to keep trying, they are allowed to try with a different ability. In this case the DC will likely stay the same.
- Increased DC: If the player decides they want to keep trying with the same ability, they DC will likely increase with each successive try.
- Decreased DC: in some rare occasions, the DC of the check might stay the same or decrease, for example, if they keep trying to break down a door with a strength save, if the dice allow it, and they can justify it well enough though storytelling, the DC might lower because for example the door is splintering making it easier to break down. These cases are highly dependent on the rolls made.

### [Group checks](a "If the party needs to achieve something together, such as sneaking past some foes as a group, how do you handle this? Does everybody in the group have to succeed on the stealth check? Perhaps if half the party succeeds on the check, it means that they are able to collectively help each other and therby succeed?")

Group check will most likely fall under the following 2 categories:

- 3 successes before 3 fails.
- Average higher than the DC/ most party members over the DC.

## Criticals

### [Critical Hits](a "RAW? Or do you roll and add maximized damage and then add modifiers? Maybe you will allow your players to choose for each campaign? Maybe you have an alternate method; if so, what is it?")

Critical hits work as described in the rules.

### [Critical Fumbles](a "Is this a rule in your game? Do you have a table, if so, what is on your fumble table? The fumble-table is something every player should be able to readily access. If you do not have a fumble table, do you instead improvise what happens on a crit-fumble?")

Dice rolls are to determine how well, within your ability, you did. On a critical failure it means you completely failed. This DM tries to combine that with “the rule of cool”. To do that on a critical failure they will ask what the player was trying to do and would like a smooch detail as they are able to provide. With that info and considering they absolutely failed the description is made.
</Discussion needs to take place is the players want to include rolling percentage to see how spectacularly they failed to add to the “rule of cool” description.>

### [Critical Success](a "Nat-20 on an ability check/save means what? What does it mean to the narrative? Do rolling a Nat-20 allow a player to get what they are after, no matter the circumstances or the ridiculousness of the roll? Would such a roll be immediately apparent in the narrative, or would it go perhaps unnoticed?")

Dice rolls are to determine how well, within your ability, you did. On a critical success it means you completely succeed. This DM tries to combine that with “the rule of cool”. To do that on a critical success they will ask what the player was trying to do and would like a smooch detail as they are able to provide. With that info and considering they absolutely succeeded the description is made.
</Discussion needs to take place is the players want to include rolling percentage to see how spectacularly they succeeded to add to the “rule of cool” description.>

### [Critical Fail](a "Nat-1 on an ability check/save means what? What does it mean to the narrative? Would such a roll be immediately apparent in the narrative, or would it go perhaps unnoticed?")

The effect of a roll is noticed immediately if it pertains to the narrative. If a roll was triggered by the DM and was failed it might mean that the players will never know the result of it or will only know it later in the narrative through other means. For example, if the DM requests a perception roll form the party which they all fail it might mean their purses are stolen and they will notice it when they need to buy something next, which might be a few days later.

## Sneaking

### [Stealth](a "Do you allow stealth movement in your game? How is accomplished? Do you require that the movement be immediately from one hiding spot to the next? Can stealth be accomplished in combat, or is it only out of combat? Consider taking the time to emphasize how Stealth/hiding in D&D is greatly different from what players may have experienced in video-games.")

Stealth in the game is accomplished though a stealth check, The PC does not need to specify they are stealthing from one hiding spot to the next but if they are out in the open the DC is higher.
Stealthing in combat is achieved though the hide action.

### [Unseen Attacker](a "What does it mean to be an unseen attacker? How does cover play into effect here? How actions/things causes an unseen attack to become revealed? How does such an attack go back to being an Unseen Attacker? Can enemies even 'target' an unseen attacker?")

Standard rules for unseen attackers apply. If the attacker's stealth check exceeds the victim’s passive perception then the victim is surprised, a surprise round is granted to the attacker and then initiative is entered. After the attack has been made, successful or not the attacker is made known and they need to succeed on a stealth check to become unseen again, it is needed to specify where in the map they will be hiding for the check to be taken seriously.
Cover works as defined in the rules. If the attacker is too well hidden it might result to disadvantage on some of their attacks based on their relative location with the victim, granting them (the victim) partial cover.

### [Hidden/hide action](a "What does it mean to be hidden? Can a hidden creature be a 'valid target'? If they can, what penalties does the attacker have against the hidden creature? What actions/things causes an hidden creature to become un-hidden? How does such a creature go back to being Hidden? Can a hidden creature clearly attack an un-hidden creature without penalty?")

Hide works as described in the rules.”

### [Invisibility](a "What does it mean to be invisible? Can an invisible creature be a 'valid target'? If they can, what penalties do they have? What actions/things causes an invisible creature to become revealed or a target? How does an invisible creature go back to being un-revealed?")

Invisibility is granted from a spell, magic item or other special ability. If the cause of invisibility does not describe the constraints of the effect the following are true:

- The creature becomes known if they cast an action while invisible.
- The creature still needs to pass stealth checks while under the effect, be it with advantage, since the ability does not make them not produce sound.
- While under the effect the person is not completely immune to attacks. If an attacker has been made aware of their location (failed stealth check, etc) and they have not moved since they are susceptible to attacks but considered under cover. The percentage of cover is case by case.

### [Traps](a "Do you as a DM use the new Unearthed Arcana rule-set for traps? Are traps a heavy feature in your game? How often can adventurers be expected to encounter a trap? Do overcoming/defeating traps provide EXP? If so, how much EXP can players expect?")

Traps and puzzles exist in the world. They are not constant but they are not uncommon either. XP is awarded if the players identify and traverse a trap or puzzle successfully. The amount of XP depends of the successful identification, form of handling and degree of difficulty of the trap.

## NPCs and creatures

### [Group initiative](a "As a DM, do you use it? If so, how? Do you break up large groups into smaller ones? If you do not use Group Initiative, what do you use instead?")

No group initiative is being used, each individual gets their own initiative. Enemies if they are too numerous they might be grouped based on location and get the same initiative but that is not that common.

### [Vendors](a "Most NPCs vendors will sell items for what cost? For base-price? Base-price+10%, +20%? will most vendors haggle or only some of them? Or will vendors not haggle at all?")

Prices will be base with the exception of remote, difficult to reach locations that need to import most items. In those cases the prices will have a markup relative to the distance the goods needed to travel and if they are perishable or not.
Haggling can be attempted in all cases but players should be aware that they might need to perform a persuasion check to even attempt haggling to begin with.

### [Other Creature rules](a "List any other creature rules you may have. Creatures in particular you may want to consider discuss are; Lycanthropes, Vampires, Intellect Devourers, Basilisk, and Medusa. These are the creatures that potentially have the likelihood of taking away player agency.")

- Creatures that take away player agency are available in the game (unless decided otherwise after discussion within the group). As NPCs they are handls as described in the rules. As a PC they are handled as described in the rules but if the player abuses the mechanic especially by using it on other PCs without their consent, there will be penalties.

## Magic items

### [Rarity](a "How rare are magic items? Can you expect to find them almost everywhere, or are the legendary relics of the past? Perhaps some items are common (potions, spell scrolls) while others are legendary and rare (weapons, armor, artifacts)?")

Rarity of magic items depends on the item itself.

### [Attunement/identification](a "Does attunement reveal everything about an item, or do PCs need to identify them to get the full list of everything an item can do? Do PCs need to identify an item before being able to attune to it?")

An item needs to be either attuned or identified for the PC to know what they are.

### [Magic resize](a "Do wearable items auto-magically resize to fit their wearer? If not, is there a way to resize such items? Perhaps only rare and above items resize while uncommon does not? Perhaps only if you attune to the item, will it resize? Maybe all magical items auto-resize? Maybe it's on a case-by-case basis?")

Wearable items auto-magically resize to fit their wearer. If they are attunable they need to be attuned to resize. If they are unattuned they keep the size of their last wearer.

### [Potions](a "Do potions take an action to use as per RAW, or can they be used by using a bonus action? Do the characters need to identify common potions (e.g. healing), or they so common that they recognize them on sight?")

The player can use potions on themselves as a bonus action, but needs to spend an action to use them on another person. PCs can identify potions if it is logical that they have encountered them before.

### [Other magic item rules](a "List any other magical items rules you may have.")

## Spells and spell effects

### [Additional/customized spells](a "Do you allow spells from the Unearthed Arcana: That Old Black Magic? Do you allow for homebrewed spells? Do you allow any class to make tweaks to spells, or do you limit that kind of thing to only the Sorcerer? If spells can be tweaked, what kind of tweaks can be made? Damage-type? Range? Duration?")

Tweaks and homebrew spells are allowed as long as they are not broken or overpowered. If a player finds a spell in a different module or even system that they want to include it will be taken under consideration.

### [Spells vs environments](a "Do spells work differently in different environments? Do fire spells work underwater? what about lightning spells underwater? Do ice spells work on the Plane of Fire? Do you have guidelines or do you make judgement calls when such circumstances happen?")

Spells work differently in different environments. Any lightning damage works differently in or around water (changes can be found in the homebrew spells in dndbeyond). If a spell has not been homebrewed in dndbeyond they will be considered as a case by case occurrence.

### [Spell Abuse](a "As a DM how do you handle things if a caster starts using spells abusively? What do you consider to be spell abuse?")

Spell abuse will be handled case-by-case. If a situation feels like the player is abusing a spell, or is close to, they will be asked to describe that they are trying to accomplish and a solution will be found.

### [Spell casting and juggling](a "Do players need to keep track of which hand carries their components, which hand they use for somatic gestures, which hand they use for foci, which hands holds their spell-book, and which hand they use for weapons? Or perhaps as DM, you don't care as long as it isn't breaking the action economy? Do you strictly enforce spell-casting rules via RAW, or do you allow some leniency?")

As long as it does not break the action economy the player does not need to keep track what hand they are using for spells and weapons.

### [Material components](a "Do spell casters need to keep track of what components they have? or can they just simply deduct 50gp for that diamond they need for Chromatic Orb? Perhaps you decided to wave all the material cost of spell components for spells below 6th level? Consider discussing what you as a DM expect from your caster players.")

Players need to keep track of their material components.

### [Spell tweaks](a "DMs list your spell tweaks here, if any.")

Any changes to existing spells are going to appear in the comments section on the spells in dndbeyond.

## Death, ressurrection and resting

### [Death](a "What happens when a PC dies? What happens when there is a TPK? Does the game end? Does it mean that time passes and events progress a certain number of years before the players can create new PCs? Should every player have a backup character ready to go? _Make sure your players know what it means when these events happens; this is something often forgotten about that brand new players need to know._")

The death of a PC will be handled in different ways depending on the reason for the death.

- If a PC dies naturally in the game the player has the possibility to introduce a new PC. Standard PC creation rules apply.
- If a PC dies because the player is being removed from or leaving the table, no new PC will be added.

### [Resurrection](a "What options, in the setting or in the game, do players have for resurrecting fallen PCs? Is this the privy of high-level PCs and gods, or can anyone bring the corpse of a fallen ally to the resurrection temple and pay a huge sum of money to resurrect a character? Do you have an alternate set of Resurrection rules. Did you pick up the rule-set that Mat Mercer recently refined for his PC resurrections? Even if you follow resurrection RAW, what impact does resurrection have in-game? Is this a common occurrence in this setting? or is it something special and unique? Will characters be expected to go get a special component (like unicorn blood, angel tears, phoenix down) otherwise resurrection spells will automatically fail?")

If the party does not have the ability for resurrection within them they can access a temple where clerics are able to do that. They will have to be able to pay the price for the materials for the resurrection. If it is one of the earlier stage resurrections, they might need to pay a higher amount for the services. Later stage resurrections will also require an amount to be paid for services but it will be lower.
Again if the party does not have any clerics the setting will accommodate even further with resurrection stones/coins. For the amount of materials plus extra the players will be able to purchase items that hold a single casting of the resurrection spell to be spent when a PC is dead. Mechanics for those items can be found in their item description.

### [Death Rules](a "DMs if you have game mechanic rules for when PCs die, discuss them here. What about Massive Damage rules; does it outright kill you? A common rule seems to be Death Exhaustion: When a character regains 1hp from after being dropped to 0hp, that character gains one level of exhaustion.")

After a PC falls unconscious they will have to succeed on 3 death saves before failing 3 in order to become stable. If they fail 3 saves before saving 3 they are rendered dead. If they are provided with healing while they are in the death saving throws all the existing rolls get wiped away. While death saving throws are being rolled, for each failed one the PC has to describe a past memory of theirs like it was flashing in front of their eyes.
Massive damage will result in instant death only if it is equal or exceeds the total max of HP of the PC. This number does not include temporary or maximum hit point increase that might have occurred from spells (ex Heroes' Feast, motivational speech).

### [Resting Rules](a "DMs if you have rules for rest mechanics discuss them here. A common rule seems to be only 2 short rest before a long rest. Another common is that a Long Rest always starts with a Short rest. Perhaps you do not gain full health on a long rest? How to tackle rest-abuse, where character take long rests unnaturally often?")

Rest follows standard rules. The ratio of short/long rests is that there cannot be more than 2 short rests between 2 long rests (only 2 short rest before a long rest). If anything happens during a long rest that interrupts it, the DM decides if the time spent resting is enough to amount to a short rest or not.

## Setting and worldbuilding

### [Collaborative worldbuilding](a "Can the players collaborate in building the world? Are they expected to? Can players be assigned to flesh out a specific area of the world related to their character?")

The burden of worldbuilding falls to the DM, if a player has an idea for a location they are welcome to bring it forth and the DM can then incorporate it to the world.

### [Player Narrative Authority](a "Do you allow your players to have some narrative authority in your game? How much say do you allow in your game/campaign, for each player? For example; can the Cleric player create the deity she follows and you as a DM allow her to decide what her deity personality, attitudes, domain, etc? Maybe the Fighter is the son of a farmer? So now there is a whole farm in your game that, when the party arrives at, the Fighter player now becomes an assistant DM. This can go a LONG way to allowing your players feel ATTACHED to the game setting.")

The players have limited narrative authority on the game. While allowed to describe any and all details that pertains to their PC it has to be discussed with the DM to be included. Any and all ideas about the narrative are however welcome, about all aspects of the game.

### [Gender](a "In your setting, are there if any, in your setting and the possibilities of encountering patriarchal or matriarchal cultures & how prevalent each are in this setting. What can characters find as the most common 'norms' for gender roles. Bring up any race/culture in your setting that has off-set or extremest views from the general gender norms you described earlier. Consider discussing the topics of creatures, deities & magic items that can change gender, if any, & how common those are. (Succubus/Incubus come to mind.)")

Patriarchal and matriarchal cultures are evenly distributed in the setting. Gender norms define what kind of community we are in. All societies are operating in all ranges of the gender norm, there are always cases of oppression of either gender as well as equality.
Gender changing items, deities and creatures exist in this setting. Since all genders are acceptable and exist in this setting there is a die roll made to determine the new gender assigned to the PC.

### [Racism and prejudice](a "Is this a fantasy setting where people are judged by their deeds and merit, on a person by person basis? Or do Elves hate Dwarves? If so why? Perhaps all the demi-human races view the goblinoid races with disdain? Is it a race by race thing? Perhaps it's all faction based? Which cultures or races are more open-minded, which ones are hugely xenophobic, which ones feel that their culture/race is superior?")

In game racism and prejudice is to be defined on a case by case basis. It will most likely be city AND race based, not just race based (not all elves are racist, but elves from a specific city most likely are). The same applies to other forms of prejudice like homophobia, ageism, general colourism, classism and so on.
